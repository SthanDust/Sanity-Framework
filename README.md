# Sthan's Fallout Mods:  Making the Wasteland a Reality since 2077

Greetings, Fellow demented Wastelanders!

This is the main site for the Sanity Framework for Fallout 4, as well as any additional Mods I may work on.

# Current Release Notes: 1.22

* Grief, Depression, Trauma will move to Actor Values for better management, and allows for NPCs to easily be added to the framework
* `Medications:` Of course, we can't have mental maladies without medications to treat them.  So, Dust Corp LLC is introducing the latest "proto-type" medications as a result of the experiments, I mean, treatments, done on the vic... I mean patients, of Vault 95.  The following drugs are patent pending Dust Corp LLC.  X with the best! Please read the fine print.  (fine print)
  - __SmileX__: Do you feel like the wasteland is making you a bit "unsane"?  Would you rather be curled in the fetal position, or sitting on a Ferris Wheel smoking a joint with Cait?  We think that latter.  SmileX will let you deal with your mental maladies with style and grace. (Side Effects: All of them).
  - __ZedX__: Anxiety making you wanna run away from combat?  Making your sex drive low?  Making you treat your companion badly? Well worry no more!  ZedX is an anxiety annihilator!  No more anxiety!  No more sadness!  Only badassedness!  (Side effects: Unknown)
  - __TearX__: Sad?  I know, the wasteland is awful.  Someone stole your caps? Dead spouse? Kidnapped Child?  We have you covered at Dust Corp, LLC.!  TearX will reduce, maybe eliminate, the blues, the doldrums, the general feeling of dread that overcomes some of us!  Talk to your local physician about how TearX can help? you.  (TearX is a rubbish product made of everything left over in the lab after ZedX and SmileX.  Results will most certainly vary.  Talk to your doctor, seriously.  We warned you.)
   - __MindRazor__`: This is our newest product, and still in the test stages, but why not give the people what they want?  We're sure you killed some people, maybe even did unspeakable things.  The wasteland is a terrible place.  Do you have terrible dreams? Want to forget about the things you've done?  It's okay, we've got you covered.  MindRazor is the most powerful drug we can think of.  It literally cuts bits out of your brains, with some odd tech we found in an abandoned cargo drop. But that's neither here nor there!  We will cut out those little bits of bad grey matter so you can go back to your lowly, I mean productive, life in the wasteland.  (No Returns or exchanges as this product is experi-"mental"  Haha... oh never mind. The puns are old now.)
* `Unique Weapons`:
  - __Batshit 1.0 (Legen-dairy Edition):__  Who want's a rubbish Swatter (Patent Pending: Todd Howard) when you can have BATSHIT 1.0 (Patent Pending Dust Corp, LLC.) Why swat, when you can go Batshit (c)?  Go Batshit (c) today!
  - __Salvation__: Why put up with the wasteland when you can end it all with a single shot to the head?  Or, you can take all your suicidal thoughts out with the Salvation 10mm!  Limited Supplies.  "Really works!" -- Customer Review
* `New Notes`: Seriously, I'm randomly adding the notes throughout the game.  So, looking at XEdit, you'll figure somethings out, but why?  Let me make Fallout 4 fun again, after like 8 years or so.  No peeking!
