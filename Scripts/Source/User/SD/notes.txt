1.1 Woe to thee, the seeker of this tome.  It isn't as amazing as you might think.  Because we are nothing but small insects on the skin of the universe.

1.2 This version is corrupted.  We are accessing though a private connection.  Please wait...  $port 233 // $dim 55 // $state 3 //

1.3 I don't understand why you feel this will in anyway change thee course of history.  Humans did stupid human things.  Unfortunately, you're just a pawn, a ghost of what used to be.  But, this is just a game, after all.
[pagebreak]
1.5 Do you want to change the world?  Think about that very carefully.  If you change the world, you too will change, forever.  You are a product of this world, this universe.  You are inexorably tied to its progression and existence.  You must choose wisely.
[pagebreak]
1.8 The others, well, they aren't as helpful as you think they may be.  We are many.  Sthan is the most "sane" of us all.  We call her "mother" because she always watches over us.  She was the first to splinter and be the protector. She will die for us, or kill us all before she will allow us to suffer.  Don't judge her too harshly.  In the end she will save you, if you trust her the most.  You'll know when to trust her.  You'll feel her hand on your heart in the times when you feel most alone.

1.13 Mother? Where are you?  It is dark and the stars are burning me.  They are looking into my soul.  Judging me. Mother? I only see darkness.  Can you see me?  Please help your son.  I am afraid.
[pagebreak]
1.21 I've found it.  The answer.  Mother if you are listening, you know where to go.  Back to the beginning.  Back to where our life ended.  The dark one comes.  This is the end for me.  Mother, I love you.
[pagebreak]
1.34 Find me, please.  I'm in the dark mansion.  Its terrifying.  Nuka World.

Chapter 1
<font size='16'>
You found the Rabbit Hole by now.  I was trying to prepare you for the raider's up ahead, and the Deathclaw.  Yes, that's a deathclaw, and if you're reading this, you survived said deathclaw, good job!  Though, this is just the beginning.

I wouldn't get too used to using Power Armor though, as it is more of a hindrance than a help.  You sound like a trashcan running through a dynamite factory.  In this world, you want to be careful and thoughtful as you travel.  No one, I mean, NO ONE is your friend.  They may pretend to be, but in actuality they are not.  But, you'll be swayed I'm sure, and then learn the hard way.  All things turn to dust, even friendships, and families, and the world, as you can see.  Trust yourself first before anyone else.

Once you finish reading this book, you will understand who I am, and what you may or may not become.

The mind is a fragile thing.  I learned this is cyrostasis while in the Manchester Vault -- Vault 89. The thing is, I wasn't asleep for the last 150 years.  I was aware the entire time that I was frozen.  Well, I should say, WE were frozen.  The splinters and I.  We number 8.  Presently, it is Sthan writing this, however, the others will certainly want a chance to communicate with the future. We are very interested in this undiscovered country.  And, we only escaped because AI is flawed.  Never ever trust a machine.

You'll need to find Alex, or rather, his journal.  We all have our own haunts, if you will.  I think I remember terrifying pictures, and a knife.  It was a bloody mess for sure.  Alex befriended a poor sod who was rather intelligent, but very, very insane.  Hence the rest of us shunned him, yet Alex could not resist spending time at that place.  Oh and I wouldn't mention us.  We had a very bad fallout.  Well.  I stabbed him at some point in a scuffle.  But we needn't talk about that.

Alex is very secretive, and he tricked us so we didn't know what he wrote.  He's very clever in fact.  But a bit of a cry baby.  Constantly feels affronted that no one respects his superior intellect.  

You should always begin your day with a trip to the Rabbit Hole.  For some reason, it seems to have odd properties.  Like, it changes from time to time.  Or maybe, that's just the rads eating away at my little brain bits.  Hmm.  Oh well.

Good luck, and I'll leave the next chapter with Grigor.  Alex's journal will light the way.

Chapter 2
<font size='16'>
I read a lot as a child.  Awkward to say the least -- sleight, plain and simple.  Books were an escape for me, before the bombs fell.  And now I live as if I am in a book, a very terrifying book.  But I've been about for some time now, learning the ways of it all.  It seems sad to me that so much was lost, or erased.  The corporations were more interested in preserving their secrets of war, deception, and extortion, rather than the secrets of life itself.

But ironically, books are the only way I can communicate with you.  I feel you as you try to survive, preserving the last vestiges of your sanity.  We are connected.  Even now, I can almost feel you breathing just behind my right ear, waiting patiently for me to leave another sign that you aren't alone, despite all those around you.  The ones that will only use you, as they do.  

Run here, fetch that, kills this. Fuck this!

I am here to tell you that you are not alone, there are others here too.  But for now, I will be at your side whenever you need me the most, I will lend you my strengths and insight.  This world is frightening, but we too are frightening. 

I've left some supplies for you in this little shack on what was once a beautiful pond.  In this shack, one of the greatest literary minds of our time ponder existence itself.

The bombs did more than tear holes in the ground, they tore holes through time and space.  I've caught glimpses of it in my dreams, your dreams.  A space between time and place.  Somehow, I am able to leave you bits in these books, if I find the correct place where the threads of fate hold our universe together, delicate like the spider's web.

Alex has reactivated something he calls "Mother".  He seems to think he can gain some inside from an older program that was active before and after the bombs fell.  If we can understand what led us here, we might find breadcrumbs back to where we began.  Soon.

We will be searching the Library next. If we find something, we will leave you a note in the Rabbit Hole.

Gabryal

<font face='$HandwrittenFont'>
<font size='24'>
<p align='left'>
Chapter 1
<font size='16'>
You must be very confused, indeed.  A walking remnant of a lifelong gone, in a world destined, from time immemorial, to destroy itself. Ma petite, you must be tired by now.  I can sense it. That desperation to find things that have no meaning to the now, or the future, or even the past.  I must say, you've astonished us all at this point, if you have found this meager tome.

Allow me to introduce myself, though I require no introductions.  I am Gabryal.  I am the architect of all that you see now.  Well, not the nonsense of finding your son, or avenging your spouse.  Those are trivial things in the grandest of schemes.  Merely props on a withered stage. Finding your son changes nothing.  Avenging your spouse is trite.  If you wish to exist in this world, you'll eventually find I'm the only one that can truly help you. 

Yes, I'm sure the others will warn you about me.  But I am the most powerful, you see.  Power is a matter of perspective, to be sure.  However, be that as it may, I am the one who allows the others to truly exist without retreating to the depths of madness.  Surely, you are swayed by the perceived strength of the girl child, Sthan.  She is rather amusing.  The rest of us feel she has a Joan of Arc mentality, which does not serve the best interests of the collective.  She is rash.  Amusing, but rash.  And this is no time to be rash.

I will now tell you the nature of existence, ma petite.  I was born in a city named Sumer more than six millennia ago.  You most likely are not familiar with my race, as we have faded into memory, recorded on the horizon of distant black holes.  The places of universal power.  We live through our accomplishments, things we set in motion all those centuries ago.  And we were the first to discover the Beast.  I was a warrior at one time, but now I am merely an advisor.  I've tried to advise the others, yet, they distrust my intentions.  As they should.  I really have no vested interest in your survival. I have no vested interest in the survival of the world.  To be honest, were it all to end today, it would benefit me more than you can know.
We are doomed to walk this insignificant rock in a universe full of equally insignificant rocks.  Why do you feel you are special?  You aren't.  You're only special in your own feeble mind.

My recommendation?  Fix yourself.  Abandon all these fruitless quests of revenge, acceptance, and grief.  Embrace the fact you are a survivor.  But you won't because humans are inherently flawed in their sense of "hope."  Hope is a construct. Nothing more.

The more you choose yourself over the others, the stronger you will become.  

Oh, and as far as Alex's Journal, it is hidden far away from here, I'm afraid.  Nasty bit of hope that.  Last I heard, he left it in the west.  My memory is not what it used to be.

Are you not sick of these little games yet?  Don't you have something better to be doing rather than chasing ghosts through the wasteland of the past?  Humans are not your friends.  They hate, they envy, they destroy and they cannot change.  This much can be seen writ on the whole of human history.  A sad lot, to be sure.

I've given up on mundane humans, so I felt the need to leave a note of my own on the fabric of space and time.  Are you the future, or are you the past?  Only time will tell. But I'm going to be wonderful and terrible all at once, because I have existed with the Magician for time immemorial.  I won't be one of your splintered selves, I am much more.

On every planet in the known multiverse, animals have existed in a delicate balance.  They have no greed, no hubris, no goals.  They simply survive and get along as best they can.  The wolf eats the deer and the deer eats the grass.  When they is not enough grass, there are not enough deer, and then there are not enough wolves.  The cycle repeats.  This is the balance you must find.

Live among the animals, and I will grant you knowledge like no other.  However, the more you spend time with the humans, you will lose these gifts, and start all over.  The cycle repeats.  Everything is a cycle.

I have sent my favourite pets to start the process, you will know where to find them.  The wolves howl their displeasure at the fog of the mind.  You must live amongst them, protect them, befriend them, and this will open the first of many gifts.

I am feel rather gracious, considering that bastard Gabryal has awakened.  He was supposed to sleep for at least another century, but your kind made him stir in the dark place we buried him, far below your petty quibbles.  We did this on purpose, because he is a force worse than anything you can imagine -- other than me, of course.  Hell hath no fury.

I am Olivia.  Go to the woods and lose yourself.  You shall be found.

One

<font face='$HandwrittenFont'>
<font size='24'>
<p align='left'>
Chapter 1
<font size='16'>
The universe is vast.  We all slumbered in the depths of space and time.  Not nearly zero, but one.  One degree too warm to stop the maddeningly glacial passage of time when all you can do is stare, into forever. One moment trapped for countless decades, centuries with nothing more to see than a trapped soul with that same despair in their eyes.

We are one, but not the only one here.

What you don't know is that this was all orchestrated.  What you don't know is this was very much the plan.  And what you don't know is that your life is a lie.  It's all a lie.  Not something orchestrated by a collective body of nefarious individuals.  They exist only to propagate their own interpretation of reality and justified existence.  This is not a simulation, this is not a figment of your imagination. This is the multiverse. And you are in this wasteland, by no fault of your own.  But you cannot escape. These are the laws that govern this universe, and your world is destroyed, forever.

Why would I tell you this?  Because, you must accept this fate, or you will go mad trying to make sense of it all.  Nuclear activity is a highly unstable variable.  You chose to try and emulate the power of a star, and now, look around you.  This is your punishment.

We are one.  Don't let despair be a substitute for logic.  
This one thing I know.

The Book of The Beast: Chapter One - The Dust Principle
This is rather cute, isn't it?  Following a crazed person's notes through the wasteland.  Are you really that bored?
We shall see how things unravel over time.  I've waited for centuries.  You were bound to destroy the world on your own, with little effort on my part.
The entropy of an isolated system always increases, thus, more chaotic.  Everything you built throughout the totality of your worthless existence will now crumble to dust, because you are nothing more than star dust.  From the dust you came, to the dust you shall return.
But that's stating the obvious, isn't it?  
The fundamental laws of the universe are immutable.  I've bided my time.  In the beginning it was amusing, but now it's unbearable.
Unfortunately for you, I've been unleashed.  See, the others didn't realize that I am nothing more than a virus, and I exist within all of you.  Sthan was supposed to keep that secret, not at my behest, but the others want to suppress me.  Names have power, and I may not speak my true name, but I'm hoping she will expose it very soon.  She has the best of intentions, but as we know, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  Though I think you've already figured by now that you are already in hell.  A hell of your own design.
This is the way the world ends.  Every time.  The cycle is diminishing until there are no more cycles. Alex's journal has the answers, but I've decided you're not ready for that revelation and Alex is a bit of a self-important wanker; with a serious substance problem.  Does he even remember his name most of the time? Does he know where he is?  I do.  I know where the journal is, but shhhh...  that's a secret we shan't discuss.
We may or may not talk again.  Because, tick tock, tick tock. I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date. Far away north.
Ta ta.
p.s. Sthan is not correct.
